Named pipes are useful as a means of communication between processes on the same machine however there can be a problem with messages from different senders getting interleaved.
Explain under what circumstances you can be sure that such messages will NOT be interleaved.

In the multiple consumer example the buffer space for the Buffer is a simple Python list which is not protected with a lock.
Explain why it is safe for access to this space not to be controlled by a lock?

(SE 370 students) Explain, giving an example, how your name server works.
(2 marks)

Files for name server
name_server.py = name server
ConsumerA, ConsumerB, .py = Clients
ServiceA, ServiceB, .py = Services

To use all of the files, open 5 terminals to run each process.
Run the name_server.py first and it will wait for messages with a timeout of 10seconds if nothing is received
You can run any file now, but for a basic run:

1) on another terminal run ServiceA.py
   What this will do is talk to the ServiceProvider (Name_server) and give its Object(ServiceA) and its pipe(address) to the name server
   and it will be stored in the name server for its lifespam.
   Once it sends it to the name_server the server will show a message in the terminal that it has received the ServiceA address and gives
   a message to ServiceA.
   ServiceA will run forever theoretically but for this assignment it will timeout in 10 seconds if nothing is received. This is to remove
   the pipes in the /tmp
2) on another terminal run ConsumerA.py
   The ConsumerA will ask for a ServiceA address and it gives its own address.
   The name_server will check its dictionary if the address exists (if it does returns the address, if not return none)
   The ConsumerA will receive a message back from the name_server with the address of ServiceA pipe and then close since it is assumed
   the consumer is querying the name_server

 You can repeat the 2 steps with the other consumer and services (Consumer A only takes Service A) -- B -> B
 The name_server, ServiceA, ServiceB will timeout after 10 seconds, this is to remove those files from the tmp folder.
 Realistically the name_server sould run forever, but for this instance it will timeout in 10 seconds if nothing is received.

 The query message protocols are
    grab - if a client and want to get a service address
    register - if a service and want to register with the name server

 Services accept any message since its a basic implementation only.
